FROM THE DEVELOPER:

HOW CAN I RUN THE GAME?

The game required JavaSE 1.8 or above to be runned. When java is already
installed in the system, simply open the .jar file, or right click the
Taplixic_0.011.jar and click open.


WHY IS IT ALWAYS DARK?

The new version (v0.011) came with the purpose of introducing lighting
and new features for the upcoming versions which will include a day/night
cycle. Without having to wait weeks for a full build without the test versions,
it's better for the user experience to experience the development process of the game.


WHY DOES THIS LEVEL.DAT FILE COME WITH THE GAME?

The level.dat file is included since the world generation can be buggy,
and the level.dat that comes with the game just provides a seed where
no bugs were encountered. Keep in mind this is just for this version
and other versions will not have this pre-installed level.dat file.

Hope you enjoy Taplixic (v0.011)!
